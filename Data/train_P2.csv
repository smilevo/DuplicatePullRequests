Improve idempotency of awsiamservercertificate provisioning;This pull request addresses issue . A brief recap followsWhen Terraform pulls down state data about AWS IAM certificates in its purview it normalizes the certificate body by trimming whitespace from it and taking a SHA hash of the resulting string. This works well for dealing with newline characters at the end of a certificate however this logic does not apply to the certificate chain. A change to the certificate chain is enough for Terraform to rebuild the resource. The combination of these two circumstances means that if one has an IAM certificate with a chain in their Terraform configuration terraform plan will always require some action even if everything appears to be in sync.This pull request normalizes the certificate chain in the same way as the certificate body. While the major gains are in the use of strings.TrimSpace the SHA hashing is nice to have as well. In passing the integration test for this resource has been updated to include a selfsigned certificate bearing a CA chain.

Adding Core support for Promises;Update PST Current state of the PR.Update PST Current state of the PR.Newcomers As a heads up GitHub has started clipping the thread down. I'm going to start cataloguing common questions tonight and I'll include them under this notice so that you can quickly look to see if there's an answer to your issue without having to search through the entire thread. Thanks for taking a look weighing in Whether you're for this change or against it your feedback is valuable and I'll respond to it as soon as I'm able.FAQ TLDR for newcomersWhat is the current proposalIf landed this will land behind a flag moving out from behind the flag in the next major version as an unsupported API finally becoming fully supported one major version after that. It does not replace or supersede the callback API which will continue to be the canonical Node interface.Promisereturning variants will be exposed for all singleoperation Node methods ?Çö that is to say Streams and EventEmitterbased APIs are not included in this discussion.To use promisesconst fs require'fs'fs.readFile.promisefilename.thendata Using promises with destructuring assignment where availableconst readFile require'fs'.promisereadFilefilename.thendata As a prerequisite to this PR landing domains must work as expected with native Promises they currently do not. AsyncWrap is not blocked on this PR neither is this PR blocked on AsyncWrap. Both PRs are blocked on getting adequate instrumentation of the microtask queue from V we need a callback for microtask enqueued events so we can track their creation and ideally a way to step the microtask queue forward ourselves running code between invocations.Why use the promisify approachResponse summed up here.Why not fs.readFileAsyncphpnode notes that it could break existing users of bluebird.promisifyAll. Plus the naming is contentious.Why not return promises when callbacks are not givenjasnell expresses deep discomfort with switching return types.We already have to provide alternate APIs in some places due toShould programmer errors throw or rejectSummed up here.What is the value in adding them to corervagg has been massively helpful in driving this conversation forwardWhat are the killer arguments for including this what is the value in adding this vs. leaving it userlanddomenic notes that asyncawait is spec'd and roadmapped.My response.mikeal notes that promises are part of the platform already and that adding support increases the base of folks willing to help fix bugs with in interoperation with themrvagg asks for clarification on the value as a part of this comment.My wordy sorry response.How do you address the need to keep core small while expanding the exposed APIWhere do we draw the line in supporting languagelevel constructsyoshuawuyts rvagg and DonutEspresso have largely driven this conversationyoshuawuyts asks.mikeal responds.brianleroux responds.My response.DonutEspresso raises concerns.My response.rvagg asks as a part of this comment.My wordy sorry response.Why are modules like require'fspromise' not in scope for this discussionphpnode RReverser mikeal ktrott and others I'm sure have brought this up and I've been pushing to have this conversation in a different later issue. The conversation has mainly revolved around consensus and the difficulty in attaining it when adding modules to the mix.ktrott does an excellent job of summing up the concern.My again wordy sorry response.This is the original text of the PR. It does not reflect the current state of the conversation. See above for common themesThis PR introduces Core support for Promises. Where possible callbacks havebeen made optional when omitted a Promise is returned. For some APIs likehttp.get and crypto.randomBytes this approach is not feasible. In thosecases promisereturning Async versions have been addedcrypto.randomBytesAsync. The naming there isn't set in stone but it'sbased on how bluebird's promisifyAllmethod generates names.This PR allows users to swap the implementation of promises used by core.This helps in a few dimensionsFolks that prefer a particular flavor of Promises for sugar methods can setthe promise implementation at applevel and forget about it.This should alleviate concerns about stifling ecosystem creativity ?Çö puttingpromises in Core doesn't mean Core needs to pick a winner.Folks who prefer a faster implementation of promises can swap in theirpreferred library folks who want to use whatever native debugging is addedat the V level for native promises can avoid swapping in promises.A world of benchmarks opens up for Promise library authors ?Çö any code in theecosystem that uses promises generated by core and has a benchmarking suiteis a potential benchmark for promise libraries.The API for swapping implementations is process.setPromiseImplementation.It may be used many times however after the first time deprecation warningsare logged with the origin of the first call. This way if a package misbehavesand sets the implementation for an application it's easy to track down.Exampleprocess.setPromiseImplementationrequire'bluebird'const fs require'fs'fs.readFile'usrsharedictwords' 'utf' .thenwords console.logthere are words.split'\n'.length words .catcherr console.errorthere are no wordsStreams are notably missing from this PR ?Çô promisifying streams is moreinvolved since the ecosystem already relies on a common and more importantlyoften pinned definition of how that type works. Changing streams will takeeffort and attention from the nodejsstreams WG. All other callbackexposingmodules and methods have been promisified or an alternative made availablethough.Three new internal modules have been addedlibinternalpromises ?Çö tracks the original builtin Promise object aswell as the currently selected Promise implementation. All promisescreated by Node are initially native and then passed to the selectedimplementation's .resolve function to cast them.libinternalpromisify ?Çö turn a callbackaccepting function into one thataccepts callbacks or generates promises. Errors thrown on the same tickare still thrown not returned as rejected promises ?Çö in other wordsprogrammer errors such as invalid encodings are still eagerly thrown.libinternalcallbackify ?Çö turn a synchronous or promisereturning functioninto a callbackaccepting function. This is only used in libreadline forthe completer functionality. This could probably fall off this PR but itwould be useful for subsequent changes to streams.Breaking ChangesIn general any API that would have thrown with no callback most likely doesnot throw now.fs APIs called without a callback will no longer crash the process with anexception.ChildProcesssend with no callback no longer returns Boolean insteadreturns Promise that resolves when .send has completed.Wrapped APIschildprocess.ChildProcesssendcluster.disconnectdgram.Socketbinddgram.Socketclosedgram.Socketsenddgram.Socketsendtodns.lookupServicedns.lookupdns.resolvefs.accessfs.appendFilefs.chmodfs.chownfs.closefs.existsfs.fchmodfs.fchownfs.fdatasyncfs.fstatfs.fsyncfs.ftruncatefs.futimesfs.lchmodfs.lchownfs.linkfs.lstatfs.mkdirfs.openfs.readFilefs.readdirfs.readlinkfs.realpathfs.renamefs.rmdirfs.statfs.symlinkfs.unlinkfs.utimesfs.writeFilenet.SocketsetTimeoutreadline.Interfacequestionrepl.REPLServercompletezlib.deflateRawzlib.deflatezlib.gunzipzlib.gzipzlib.inflateRawzlib.inflatezlib.unzipNew APIsprocess.setPromiseImplementationnet.connectAsynctls.connectAsynccrypto.randomBytesAsynccrypto.pbkdfAsynccrypto.pseudoRandomBytesAsynccrypto.rngAsynccrypto.prngAsynchttp.getAsynchttps.getAsynchttp.requestAsynchttps.requestAsyncchildprocess.execAsyncchildprocess.execFileAsyncNext stepsI haven't finished this PR yet the primary missing piece is tests for thepromisebased APIs to ensure that they resolve to the correct values. Docsalso need updated. I'll be working on this in my free time over the next week.Here are the bits that I'd like folks reading this to keep in mindThe code changes here are fairly cheap timewise ?Çö one evening's worth of work.Technical possibility has never been the primary blocker.We know asyncawait is coming down the pipe and many devs are interested init.With ChakraCore potentially coming in this may happen sooner than anyonepreviously imagined.Even sans the ChakraCore PR it's my understanding that V will be supportingasyncawait by EOY Correct me if I'm wrong herePromises may not be your cup of tea. This is okay. This is not an attempt toreplace callbacks or streams with promises. They can coexist. While Promisesare complicated much of that complication falls out of the problem space thatboth callbacks and promises abstract over. Give this a fair shake.

test avoid testclustermasterkill flakiness;Checklist tests and code linting passes a test andor benchmark is included the commit message follows commit guidelinesAffected core subsystemstest clusterDescription of changeI've observed that testclustermasterkill fails intermittently on an AIX . machine oslevel due to timeout before worker termination. There was a previous PR nodejsnodev.xarchive which arbitrarily increased the timeout for AIX to second however this value is still a guess and appears to be insufficient. It's also worth noting the arbitrary timeouts have also caused problems for other platforms see comment. Arbitrary timeouts cannot compensate for external factors such as system load.In this PR I propose removing the timeout mechanism entirely here is how the test currently worksFork a master process from the test harness.The master uses cluster.fork to create a worker.The worker starts an HTTP server.The master will kill itself with process.exit.The worker will then also call process.exit as part of its IPC pipe disconnect handler. The test harness will wait an arbitrary amount of time after the master's exit to check for the child's liveness if it is still alive the test fails. Without this mechanism the worker would become an orphan child of init.Step is inherently flaky. The test was originally added as part of nodejsnodev.xarchivededifffaafcddeebbcdcR where it specifically tested the new disconnect pathway.The test boils down to the following actionsCause the worker's disconnect handler to be run by calling exit in the cluster master.Insure that the disconnect handler also exits the worker process.Since step does not actually require step I propose the following alternate flowFork a master process from the test harness.The master uses cluster.fork to create a worker.The worker starts an HTTP server.The master kills the IPC pipe note this not the same as using the graceful cluster shutdown API in nodejsnodev.xarchivecc which causes the child to disconnect itself. Ungracefully closing the IPC pipe causes the child to execute the same disconnect handler it executes when the master calls exit.The master waits for the child's exit event.The test harness checks for the child's liveness after the master's exit event.With this setup there is no need for the arbitrary wait time. The obvious problem is if the child never exits the test will hang however in that case the test will still be killed by the test harness's global timeout.I do believe a timeout mechanism is useful for detecting liveness issues but the presence of arbitrary timeouts in the tests themselves should be minimized the single timeout in the test harness suffices.Any comments are appreciated especially from AndreasMadsen.

The PR passed CITGM and CI on multiple runs and was landed as a semvermajor in v. Unfortunately it came to light after that the change breaks a number of other cases.This reverts the change and adds two additional test cases one for the original behavior and a knownissue test for the symlinked peer dependency case.This puts the new functionality behind the preservesymlinks command line flag. The prev behavior is the default. Using the preservesymlinks command line option will make Node.js use the new behavior.This should be considered to be a temporary solution until a better fix for the symlinked peer dependencies problem is figured out.Refs

You can avoid doing this with npm shrinkwrap onlyprod. Likewise if your shrinkwrap contains dev dependencies you can avoid installing them with npm install onlyprod or setting NODEENV to production.prepublish has been deprecated replaced by prepare. A prepublishOnlyscript has been temporarily added which will only run on npm publish.npm search rewritten to stream results and no longer supports sorting.npm scripts no longer prepend the path of the node executable used to runnpm before running scripts. A scriptsprependnodepath option has beenadded to configure this behavior.npat has been removed.npm outdated exits with exit code if it finds any outdated packages.npm tag has been removed after a deprecation cycle. Use npm disttag.Other notable changesnpm will now send NpmInCI and NpmScope headers to registries when fetching modules. The former will allow registries to more accurately distinguish between CI and user traffic. The latter will allow registries to implement features on the basis of the scope of the project rather than the module actually being installed.Changelogsv..v..v..r jasnellr Fishrock

test build test addons like thirdparty addons;Until now we built addons by pointing nodegyp at the src directory.We've had at least one DOA release where addons were broken because ofa header dependency issue that wasn't caught because we build our testaddons in a nonstandard way.This commit does the followingUse toolsinstall.py to install the headers to testaddonsinclude.Add a script to build everything in testaddons.Remove the pileup of hacks from the Makefile.The same logic is applied to testaddonsnapi and testgc.Everything is done in parallel as much as possible to speed up builds.Ideally we derive the level of parallelism from MAKEFLAGS but it lacksthe actual jn flag. That's why it simply spawns as many processesas there are processors for now.The exception is toolsdocaddonverify.js I switched it to synchronouslogic to make it easy to use from another script. Since it takes no timeat all to do its work that seemed like a reasonable tradeoff to me.Refs CI httpsci.nodejs.orgjobnodetestpullrequest

Modified GMM initialization to only use linear memory and time in sphà;Reference IssueNot an reported issue to my knowledge.What does this implementfix Explain your changes.When running a 'diag' GMM on a highdimensional feature space a Memory Error was thrown. This is suspicious because quadratic memory should not be used for diagonal GMM fitting. Indeed there was a section of gmm.py that had a needless covariance matrix calculation for the 'diag' and 'spherical' cases.The modified code fixes that behavior should be the same for 'diag'.For 'spherical' the previous code initialized the variance term to the average value of all terms in the covariance matrix. The new code CHANGES this behavior now it is the average value of the diagonal terms only. This is a more appropriate initialization anyway.Any other comments

MRG Pretty decision trees tree.exportgraphviz;As mentioned in this enhancement is intended to make the output of tree.exportgraphviz more aesthetically pleasing as inspired by fancyRpartPlot in R.

I'm thinking a diverging colour scheme with white for the median or mean of the two most extreme values in the leaves should work well.Should the text and graphical options be broken out further Something like showmajorclass usecolours usepercentages etc. or some perhaps discarded. I based the options off the R package that's not meant to imply that this is the state of the art just the best I've stumbled across.Should the base implementation even be maintained The extra subtree recursion per node is a little expensive but it's just a single tree... And seeing what each node is voting towards gives more intuitive information than the error coefficients alone. It even appears that this used to be standard output from the examples hereOther options that might be usefulLeft to right orientation for use in reportsAnything else you can think of Though Graphviz is a little limited in what you can pull offWelcome any other suggestions gotchas

Use new features of JHtmlscript and etc...;Pull Request for Issue .Summary of ChangesUse the new features of JHtmlscript to set IE conditional scripts and versioned scripts.Also set meta data on the document object rather than writing it directly in the template.Basically this PR removes direct writing of some tags to the document head and lets the the head renderer take care of those things instead.This does not fix any known bug or make anything noticeably better to the end user but Joomla's included templates should serve as examples to template developers so I think it's a good idea for them to make use of features like this as much as possible.Testing InstructionsCompare the output html source in the head tag before and after applying this patch. A few tags may have moved around in some inconsequential manner and the uncompressed versions of some scripts may be used which weren't before applies to debug mode only but everything should still be there and continue to work exactly as before.Documentation Changes RequiredNope

Apply onthefly class aliases even for Composer packages;Fixes ghTechnical descriptionThe librariesclassmap.php file registers class aliases with JLoader. This works fine when a developer creates an object using the old class name e.g. JRegistry instead of the new class e.g. Joomla\Registry\Registry. However this causes an issue when PHP doesn't try to autoload a class e.g. when the old class name is in the right hand side of instanceof. Examplefoo new \Joomla\Registry\Registry vardumpfoo instanceof \Joomla\Registry\Registry returns true vardumpfoo instanceof JRegistry returns falseHowever if you have forced the autoloader to run you have no problem. Examplefoo new \Joomla\Registry\Registry classexists'JRegistry' true Dummy line just to force the autoloader to run vardumpfoo instanceof \Joomla\Registry\Registry returns true vardumpfoo instanceof JRegistry returns true nowWe can't use static classalias calls because PHP needs to load the original class causing memory and performance issues. Instead we need a way to create the aliases onthefly when either then old class is loaded via the dynamic alias set in JLoader or through the new namespaced class name through Composer.This patch uses a fork of the \Composer\Autoload\ClassLoader class which calls JLoaderapplyAliasForclass when loading a class. This allows us to register class aliases on the fly when the new namespaced class is being loaded. Moreover the same trick is applied to all of the JLoader autoloaders. This results in perfect backwards compatibility while we are proceeding with the namespacing of the core code.Backwards compatibilityThis patch actually fixes backwards compatibility Performance impactI could not measure performance impact not because of lack or try or incompetence but because of variance. Therefore I conclude that the performance impact is statistically not important. In layman's terms it's so small you can't even separate it from the variance in page load times added by external factors such as filesystem caches code caches web server thread management etc.As for the memory impact it is about .Kb per aliased class. Even with hundreds of classes the memory impact is miniscule compared to the core code memory footprint.

ContentHelperRoutegetArticleRoute needs to be called with catid and language;While working on I noticed that we never use the language value of the article when calculating the URL for it. Basically it means that we don't care if an english article is assigned to a french menu item etc. Long story short If you want to get the right URL you need to provide the article ID the category ID and the language.Testing instructions See that Joomla now creates the same and right URLs everywhere. Except for the TOS in the user plugin... Can't fix that one...This testing instructions actually mean that this needs a code review rather than a test.For those looking for numbers We have files where ContentHelperRoutegetArticleRoute is called.

Config doesn't output error message when we have a required field PHP validation not JS;This is the same fix as here except that in the old pull request I've somehow screwed it up...When I originally fixed this issue the configuration didn't have Javascript validation. That is why I was able to run into this. Right now the config has a javascript validation and we can only run into the issue when we turn it off. But despite the fact that we can't run into the issue when js validation is on it doesn't change the fact that the php code is wrong.Testing instructionsFirst we need to disable the javascript validation. Go toadministrator\components\comconfig\view\component\tmpl\default.phpcomment out line . At the end your code should look like thisJoomla.submitbutton functiontask  if task config.cancel.component || document.formvalidator.isValiddocument.getElementByIdcomponentform  Joomla.submitformtask document.getElementByIdcomponentform  After that test it with CMandrillFirst download CMandrill fromhttpscompojoom.comdownloadsofficialreleasesstablemandrillthen install it. Now go to components CMandrill options. Go to the permissions tab and try to change any permission. Save. The page will refresh without any error message and the permissions that you've applied shouldn't be saved.Now apply the patch and try to save the config again. This time you'll see the error message.

Refactoring comfields to no longer use comcategories;This is a bigger refactoring of comfields to get rid of the use of comcategories for its field groups fieldset feature.During the rewrite I found also several code pieces which are unused or were copypasted from comcategories but don't make sense in the context of fields.I also replaced the useage of some deprecated methods.So forgive me that it become a bit bigger than initially planned Summary of ChangesMain thing is that the field groups are now handled in comfields using own views.ACL should work now at least better than before.Testing InstructionsMake sure managing the fields and groups worksAlso test that the fields appear as expected. You don't have to test the indivual field types as I haven't changed anything there.Please also test ACL. It should inherit permissions from component to field group to field. I haven't had the time yet to test that myself but in theory the code should work.Documentation Changes RequiredIf there already is documentation how to implement comfields into an extension that will need to be adjusted.Needs a helper method which returns possible contexts.Needs added permission sections in the access.xml file.

Height of a form field type editor the Tiny MCE plugin overrides custom settings;The XML code I have in my extensions for the form field type editor did not use my defined height of px it always shows the standard height of px I think that this is a bug in the Tiny MCE plugin.

What I have done is instead of getting the data from the responce.data automatically it is now a configurable function that defaults to the current process.There is now a th optional parameter for resource that is the function used to parse for the data of the response so that if the REST API you are working with has the data formatted slightly or completely different than excepted it is very easy to still use the resource module.An example of a REST API that has a different response the what resource right now except for be the Jira REST API.I have already submitted the electronic CLA.

Don't send empty String in place of no body;XMLHttpRequest.send spec defines different semantics for an empty string as compared to null any string whether empty or not should be sent with a ContentType of textplain whereas null should have no ContentType header set.

Fix issue with Jquery for ngMobile;IssueI found that the ngClick directive does not work with touch events dispatched by JQuery.JQuery will wrap touch events and touches can only be found on originalEvent.The touch event handlers in ngClick directive are not using the originalEvent but event insteadso the touches these handlers use are 'undifined'.Also I found browsers are quite sensitive with touch when I just tap on my touch screenthe browser will dispatch 'touchstart' 'touchmove' and 'touchend'. Since the touch move handleralso reset status I never get my click handler triggered.FixCheck if event has an originalEvent property and use it instead if it is found.Also I make touch end handler triggers click handler if the distance between touch start and touch endis within MOVETOLERANCE.

fixorderBy ensure correct ordering with arrays of objects and no predicate;This fix also considerably refactors how the orderBy filter works in internally.The new algorithm precomputes the predicate values for the array being ordered. This makes the algorith easier to follow but also ensures that this computation is done a maximum of n times whereas in the previous algorithm it could be greater. The downside is that we must temporarily store this intermediate array.There could be performance implications but they are as likely to be beneficial as detrimental. It could probably do with benchmarking.Closes

refactorparse new and faster parse;Change the way parse works from the old mechanism to a multiple stagesparsing and code generation. The new parse is a four stages parsingLexerAST buildingAST processingCacheing onetime binding and watch optimizationsThe Lexer phase remains unchanged.AST building phase follows Mozilla Parse API and generates an AST that is compatible. The only exception was needed for filters as JavaScript does not support filters in this case a filter is transformed into a CallExpression that has an extra property named filter with the value of true. This phase is heavily based on the previous implementation of parse.The AST processing phase transforms the AST into a function that can be executed to evaluate the expression. The logic for expressions remains unchanged. The AST processing phase works in two different ways depending if csp is enabled or disabled. If csp is enabled the processing phase returns pregenerated function that interpret specific parts of the AST.When csp is disabled then the entire expression is compiled into a single function that is later evaluated using Function. In both cases the returning function has the properties constant literal and inputs as in the previous implementation. These are used in the next phase to perform different optimizations.The cacheing onetime binding and watch optimizations phase remains mostly unchanged. httpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsMozillaProjectsSpiderMonkeyParserAPI

adjust tooltip placement when rendered off screen to the right previously only happened on the left;I modified the bootstrap tooltip and by extension popovers to include behavior that previously only happened when the tooltip was cut off on the left side of the screen. When a tooltip was activated if a portion was to be rendered off the left side of the screen it was shifted to the right and the arrow was moved to the left. This did not happen when cut off to the right side. This code accomplishes the same desired behavior on both sides.

v Updated form and button sizing;Fixes .Long story short the funky vertical padding values we had for inputs and buttons were causing fucked up computed heights when the root fontsize is changed from px to px. This PR updates inputs and buttons toUse easier math e.g. .rem on default buttons to more readily support root fontsize changes.Due to the increased padding we now use a tighter lineheight . instead of inherited .. This lineheight is the same across all input and button sizes.Some mixins and size variation styles were cleaned up as well.

Separate push pull offset for Large and Small grids;There is a discussion going on about this but I had to fix the problem to get our theme working with Bootstrap .If you're going to have multiple grids you have to do pushes pulls and offsets for both grids separately. I really don't see a way around this. Consider the following Inside a container row div classcollg colsm Some Textdivdiv classcollg colsm colpush Some More Textdivdiv classcollg colsm colpull Corporate Logodivalso available as a fiddleThis is going on the traditional info bar at the bottom of every page look at the bottom of any modern web page to see what I'm talking about. On tablet and large screens I want the corporate logo to be centered. On the tablet the logo can be a little bigger because I'm going to hide some of the text in the info boxes.However there is currently no way whatsoever to specify that the pushing and pulling is different on the small grid. If the small grid is set to the same as the large grid collg colsm colpush of course it works just fine. But if the grid changes for tablets then push pull and offset all break miserably.With this patch you can change the above code to Inside a container row div classcollg colsm Some Textdivdiv classcollg colpush colsm colsmpush Some More Textdivdiv classcollg colpull colsm colsmpull Corporate LogodivClasses get a bit cluttered but honestly I see no other way to do this.

v Move to npm scripts;This PR is heavily WIP but addresses a growing concern I've had with developing Bootstrapùthe build process is way to convoluted. Currently we make use of Grunt npm Bundler Jekyll etc all just to run our docs and compile source assets. More personally I find the current dev process incredibly fatiguingùas a maintainer it's hard to be motivated to jump into this codebase right now.My goal here is to overhaul the build process and make Bootstrap development more approachable to everyone myself included. Originally I was thinking Gulp would be our answer but it's still a task runner build on npm rather than npm itself.So far I've started to pull apart a few bits of our current tooling and replacing them with npm scripts. Right now they all live under tasks and are split by dist and docs. I'm probably doing a ton wrong but maybe you can help with that D.Here's the list of tasks we need for developing and distributing Bootstrap CSS Lint Sass before trying to compile with stylelint over scsslint Compile Sass files with nodesass no more Ruby options Compile and minify Sass files Autoprefixer compiled CSS files JavaScript Babel Uglify Qunit tests Concatenate and minify Docsdevelopment Update version Shrinkwrap dependencies Lint HTML files Run Jekyll and watch SassJS files stylelint compile autoprefixer Saucelabs Package dist files in zipfile for release Deploy Jekyll site directory to remote to update docs siteI'm probably missing some tasksscripts we need but I do believe we need the above. These tasks should be runnable by us as maintainers as well as casual users who wish to extend Bootstrap's code and docs so I want them to be clear concise and documented.cc twbsteam

FixOptimisation of TextReader;If a long piece of text is defined in cocosStudio with a custom font TextReader will unnecessarily and implicitly build the label with the default system font first. It will also trigger repeat recalculations of the label's size atlas and system font texture via the setFontName and setFontSize calls.By setting the text content last we can drastically minimise this overhead.Furthermore if the text content is large the system font renderer will potentially produce a texture wider than the maximum texture size of the device. This is avoided with the given change for custom fonts but will still pose an issue for large labels relying on the default system font.

This wayinstead of returning default returns None.This also fixes possible data eviction problemsbetween setting and getting a key.

BUGFIX When selecting controller for view prioritize controllerName over controller matching template or route name;When specifying controllerName in a route if a controller exists with a name matching the template name it will be ignored.This seems to go against the documentation for controllerName which states that the specified controllerName will be used as the controller for the view being rendered by the route.We have added a test for this particular case.

Ember.Arrangable mixin SortableMixin FilterableMixin;This PR take commits from and combines that with the existing SortableMixin. This makes it easier to use both at the same time. It also should be more performant in the combined use case because it does not have to loop over the content array twice to add observers. The existing api from Ember.SortableMixin is mirrored for filtering. You can specify filterProperties the same as sortProperties.There is one failing test ATM. The test is carried over from the Ember.SortableMixin and the other PR. I've added more tests around filtering and sorting the same array.I've pushed this code to say that I'm serious about this feature. This is a major pain point of us. I can't see why there can't be one single mixin to do this.The original implementation is from crofty. I've simply pulled his commits and refactored them so they can be merged with Ember.SortableMixin.Edit I've realized that I completely suck at spelling andor typing.

Like the each helper documents the parameters name and path but it's not clear how they're used and what they represent.Instead would it make sense to document the syntax of the helpers with a sort of grammar I like how MDN documents the formal syntax of CSS rules. For instance the formal syntax of the boxshadow rule is as follows httpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebCSSboxshadowFormalsyntaxnone | inset offsetx offsety blurradius spreadradius color Using this for helpers you could have something as follows for eacheach array itemViewClassitemviewclass emptyViewClassemptyviewclass itemControlleritemcontroller as |item|In any case correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think that in their current format the documentation of the parameters are particularly useful to most of the Ember.js users.

Add filter for undefined options.path during componenttest blueprintgenerator;Howdy folks I don't know the root cause of this issue but I thought I thought I would open the discussion with a PR that actually fixes it for me.The issue occurs when I use ember g componenttest supercomponent from the command line. The render calls in the generated tests have the component name prepended with a for some reason. Here is what it looks like this.renderhbssupercomponent this.renderhbs supercomponent template block text supercomponent Doing a bit of debugging I found that options.path was undefined when coming into the generator but like I said I don't know why that might be the case.

Replacement for Base.Test ready for review;The goal of this PR is to make Base.Test better than just assert with some fancier output. It does so primarily by introducing testset which lets users bundle tests together and delay throwing an error until the end.Designwise it primarily needs to be nonbreaking for . uses of the current Base.Test and be simple minimal and relatively opinionfree. It is clear there is a large space of possibilities for testing frameworks but I don't want to go there personally. My goal is for a incremental improvement over the existing Base.Test if someone wants to pick up the ball and add more features later they can. A thing that falls outside the scope includes fancier outputs to e.g. files.This PR is basically httpsgithub.comIainNZBaseTestNext.jl. It is a dropin replacement for Base.Test and all tests except for those in testtest.jl pass without modification.Features for later PRs probably not by meUse the special formatting on Travis for expandcollapse via simonbyrneEnable changing the default test set used which then enables custom output e.g. JSON XMLtestapprox needs to be either included in the testset world or even better deprecated in favor of isapprox based testing.Some demo output from BaseTestNext.jl

ENH support for nanosecond time in offset and period;closes This pull request fixes handling of nanosecond times in periods and offsets. In addition it simplifies the internal processing of intraday periods.In pd.daterange'' periods freqpd.offsets.NanoOut class 'pandas.tseries.index.DatetimeIndex' ... .Length Freq N Timezone NoneIt requires Numpy . to work using Numpy . yields the original behaviour before this PR.This is the continuation of after it was merged without effect fixing issue .The biggest part is a refactoring of pandassrcperiod.c to use a conversion factor matrix for intraday conversion. This minimizes the impact of adding three more intraday time units ms us and ns. Thus the amount of frequency conversion methods is reduced to one per intraday frequency source or target. The intraday conversion factor is looked up in the conversion factor matrix inside the method.Nanosecond support is only available when using numpy .. When using with numpy . everything except nanosecond support should work as expected.

Bailout if the element and the context is unchanged properly;Currently We use to check if a context is changed before bailing out but we create a new context everytime a compnent is updated regardless the origin context provided by the consumer is unchanged.As a result would always return false unless the context is undefined. That is when there is a context a component would never be bailed out. Specifically If we use reactredux reactrouter reactintl or any other lib which provides a context we would get no bailout optimization.To fix this I suggest we use shallowEqual instead of .

Add React benchmarking infrastructure;This is currently a WIP and is not yet complete.The aim of this PR is to give us better tracking of performance and bundle sizes as we make changes to the React codebase.To do this new infrastructure is needed to validate our code changes against predefined benchmarks. We can do this using Google's Lighthouse tool performance markers in the benchmarks an automated build process. For now the benchmarking script does a build and benchmark run comparing the local React repo and a remote merge base React repo.The end goal is to have this process run on a CI pipeline which can provide us feedback in buildsPRs so we have constant feedback in regards to performance improvements and regressions.To test how this works runyarn benchFrom the branch on this PR. It should take a few minutes to run and report back the performance metrics of local and remote merge base.There are still things that need to be finished Provide a better visual output of results when yarn bench is run Add bundle size comparison checks and remove the existing code for showing branches from the Rollup build process it will become redundant with this feature Add more benchmarks other than the functionalcomponents benchmark Add bootstrapped sampled data over results to help show confidence in figures Add additional CLI options to better refine bench runs

Properly handle direct event dispatches;When registering events to onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave in a component these events cannot be tested using the TestUtils. The methods TestUtils.Simulate.mouseEnter and TestUtils.Simulate.mouseLeave do exist but the event is never actually dispatched since makeSimulator function only calls accumulateTwoPhaseDispatches which does not cover mouseEnter and mouseLeave.Adding a call to accumulateDirectDispatches takes care of this and the events are being dispatched normally.

Workaround for dealing with exceptions thrown in asynchronous render method;We provide a workaround for this issue by allowing the user to define a callback function to be executed whenever an exception is thrown inside the body of a render method.

Change tabIndex to MUSTUSEATTRIBUTE to avoid special focus treatment in Chrome;Chrome treats anchor tags with an explicit tabIndex'' different then if the attribute was not present.

Robust animationend handling in ReactCSSTransitionGroup;As described in the transitionend event is buggy and prevents some animations from being cleanedup. This PR taking a lead from the Khan Academy's TimeoutTransitionGroup httpsgithub.comKhanreactcomponentsblobmasterjstimeouttransitiongroup.jsx requires developers to specify timeout durations for each kind of animation to ensure that they get cleanedup. Enabling transitions without providing timeouts now logs a deprecation warning.This solution isn't perfect but in the absence of a more robust animationevent API it's the best that can be done. This change allows developers to produce reliable animations with ReactCSSTransitionGroup which would otherwise be impossible.

Fixes additional calls to rAF.;Often a rAF callback will request another rAF from the callback itself.Previously the constellation would quickly receive two messages sayingthat there were no animations and then there are animations again in thesituation above. This would make the compositor tick the new animation straightaway causing strange fluctuations and timings in rAF callbacks.Instead only send the NoAnimationCallbacks message if the animationcallback queue is still empty after invoking the callbacks.This fixes rAF timing which now runs at the correct vsync framerate.

Example on the profiler data collector page at the bottom click on the XML tab and you will see it is not highlighted.The documentation can't be compiled with newer versions of Sphinx ..x as it results in errors because of these syntax errors.This is a regression since the Symfony . docs as there was no syntax error before.The YAML error is indeed an error backslashes need to be escaped in doublequote strings.Screenshot of a nonhighlighted code due to the commented attribute which is not allowed in XML       The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered

Fix for the implementation of Collection Element;The current implementation of Collection Element imposes in prepareFieldset that the child element keys are set sequentially starting from . After that populateValues will remove the unused indexes and add new ones according to the input data. This behaviour breaks the test in this commit as it expects that the first key will always be which is not always true as when collection elements are dinamically added or removed with javascript. The changes done here makes Collection Element more flexible and maybe a little faster as it saves resources by avoiding unnecessary creation of child elements adding them just when neccessary. Also selflastChildIndex can be sent along with the template so javascript can set a proper index for the next element to be added. FieldsetPrepareAwareInterface and all its references were removed as they are no longer necessary.

Fix make checkstage by fixing deps of exported syntax cfail tests.;Our make checkstageN for all N including N was not workingbecause there is an unspecified dependence from the cfail tests oncertain crates that export syntax.We need to encode that dependence in some manner. The quick hack isto add CSREQTH SREQTH to thedependency list for all of the cfail tests. But I would prefer tonot force the make logic to build all of the external crates before itgets to exercise the cfail tests.So here is how this PR fixes the problem more properlyAdd CTESTDEPScfailfull that analogous toCTESTDEPSrpassfull has a dependency onCSREQTH SREQTH.CTESTDEPScfail is left unchanged and thus continues tomatch the structure of CTESTDEPSrpass.Added all of the other ingredients for cfailfull family of makelogic.moved cfail tests that rely on macros in separate crates toseparate compilefailfulldeps directory.Landing this may or not be a prerequisite for landing PR . Inany case this is a pretty isolated change and a net improvement inthe overall structure for the tests IMO at least given what wecurrently have in the makefiles.

mk Bootstrap from stable instead of snapshots;This commit removes all infrastructure from the repository for our socalledsnapshots to instead bootstrap the compiler from stable releases. Bootstrappingfrom a previously stable release is a longdesired feature of distros becausethey're not fans of downloading binary stage blobs from us. Additionally thismakes our own CI easier as we can decommission all of the snapshot builders andstart having a regular cadence to when we update the stage compiler.A new srcetcgetstage.py script was added which shares some code withsrcbootstrapbootstrap.py to read a new file srcstage.txt which liststhe current stage compiler as well as cargo that we bootstrap from. This scriptwill download the relevant rustc package an unpack it into targetstage aswe do today.One problem of bootstrapping from stable releases is that we're not able tocompile unstable code e.g. all the feature directives in libcorelibstd.To overcome this we employ two strategiesThe bootstrap key of the previous compiler is hardcoded into srcstage.txtenabled as a result of and exported by the build system. This enablesnightly features in the compiler we download.The standard library and compiler are pinned to a specific stage whichdoesn't change so we're guaranteed that we'll continue compiling as we startfrom a known fixed source.The process for making a release will also need to be tweaked now to continue tocadence of bootstrapping from the previous release. This process looks likeMerge beta to stableProduce a new stable compiler.Change master to bootstrap from this new stable compiler.Merge master to betaProduce a new beta compilerChange master to bootstrap from this new beta compiler.Step above should involve very few changes as master was previouslybootstrapping from beta which is the same as stable at that point in time.Step however is where we benefit from removing lots of cfgstage andget to use new features. This also shouldn't slow the release too much as steps requires little work other than waiting and step just needs to happen atsome point during a release cycle it's not time sensitive.Closes Closes        The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered

ActionCable Add a welcome and ping message type;SummaryThis pull request does three thingsFixes inconsistencies in the ActionCable protocol between server and client in regards to the ping message by making ping a message type instead of an identifier.Adds a welcome message type which signals to clients the server is ready or has reopened the connection.Removes ConnectionMonitor as a subscriber as this is no longer necessary when pings and welcome messages can be identified separately.Other InformationThe ping message was being sent looking likeidentifier ping message whereas other messages were being sent to look liketype confirmsubscription ...Now the ping looks liketype ping message Consequently this enabled some code to trick the client and tests to be removed and for some clean up in how the ConnectionMonitor works.

Fix for Hashdeeptransformkeys and Hashdeeptransformkeys;The methods Hashdeepstringifykeys and Hashdeepsymbolizekeys are not working as I would expect.

For example I would expecthash 'a' 'b' 'c' hash.deepsymbolizekeys a b c expected behaviorhash.deepsymbolizekeys a b 'c' actual behaviorDigging through the source it became apparent that the culprit is the method Hashdeeptransformkeys. It does not traverse hashes that are contained in nested arrays. I've modified both Hashdeeptransformkeys and Hashdeeptransformkeys to traverse hashes in nested arrays and added additional test cases for these scenarios. These changes result in the expected behavior of Hashdeepstringifykeys and Hashdeepsymbolizekeys and their corresponding bang methods.

Fixing issue with activerecord serialization not being able to dump a record after loading it from YAML fixes;This is a backwards incompatible change for people using storeserialization.This PR fixes the issue raised at The main issue is that encodewith says that the attributes value that is set to the coder object is the same that gets set at initwith and while this is true initwith calls self.class.initializeattributescoder'attributes' without setting the serialized option and creates the SerializationAttibute object with the serialized field set to true as can be seen here but the YAML produced by a YAML.dump call is like this rubyobjectAdminUserattributes id  name John Doe settings rubyhashActiveSupportHashWithIndifferentAccess color black preferences rubyhashActiveSupportHashWithIndifferentAccess rememberlogin true jsondata rubyhashActiveSupportHashWithIndifferentAccess height tall jsondataempty rubyhashActiveSupportHashWithIndifferentAccess isagoodguy true params rubyhashActiveSupportHashWithIndifferentAccess  accountid The jsondata field that should have been a JSON string since it's store coder turns it into JSON before saving it was saved just like any YAML field. Now when you YAML.load the content above you will get the following errorTypeError no implicit conversion of ActiveSupportHashWithIndifferentAccess into StringAnd it happens because the initwith method expected to receive a JSON string at the jsondata field and not the ActiveSupportHashWithIndifferentAccess since serialized will be set to true. That's why at the original issue description hundredwatt says that calling record.reload works because when you call reload at the object initwith is called with the data as it comes from the database column that will be a JSON string and not a real hash object.The solution here was creating a separate attributesforcoder method that the serialization code can override when needed to generate the encoded value for the field so it can be safely dumped and then loaded back again through the correct process.

ActionViewLookupContext jshtml fallback redo;I made pull request about a year ago and received comments recently. I messed up that merge from railsrails master so that pull request somehow has an extra commits or so.ActionViewLookupContext is hardcoded to append the html format whenever js is set as the format. A user may want to extend this behavior to their own custom defined formats for example a mobile format could fallback to html as well.This is what it was forThis current behavior is the magic behind allowing you to render an html partial within a javascript response. in new.js.erb will render the form.html.erb partialrender partial 'form' locals object objectThis change allows you to specify your own fallbacks easily. In somewhere like configinitializersmimetypes.rbMimeTypes.registeralias texthtml mobileActionViewLookupContext.formatfallbacksmobile htmlNow if you have a request where the format is mobile it will try to render a mobile template first and fallback to the html template. Additionally you could render an html partial within a mobile template.This behavior is already being tested in actionpacktesttemplatelookupcontexttest.rb.

Do not escape HTML entities in text files;Rails escapes HTML entities in erb files. This is great because it prevents Cross Site Scripting and other evil attacks.

However ERB still handles this as an html file and escapes HTML entities.For example if my template contains Dear customername ... and customername is Foobar Partner then the mail will contain Dear Foobar amp Partner.The following commit just disables HTML escaping in text templates.

adjust apibehavior to display updated data after a patchput request;Hi This is not a brand new request sometime last year a similar thing was proposed but at the time it perhaps made sense to leave rails the way it was. I'd argue that with some recent trends in application development it might now be worthwhile to revisit the issue.Namely at the moment an API update PATCHPUT request yields nocontent. This is technically a correct approach according to Roy Fielding's HTTP Protocols httpwww.w.orgProtocolsrfcrfcsec.html and as pointed out by Steve Klabnik thusly in March If an existing resource is modified either the OK or No Content response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.At the moment we see a response in Rails. Again technically correct. However the past year and a half have heralded a rise in the use of a SOA approach to software engineering especially in the Rails application community. Given the increase in the sheer number of APIs the time spent editing APIs and the instances of updates made through APIs that accompany this trend we want to make it as convenient as possible in Rails for folks to develop use and read APIs?Çöincluding checking their work. By changing the apibehavior method to show the updated data request after data is updated through an API rather than a nocontent request we save API users the step of manually checking the updated data in their rails console or database editor to make sure it's correct. This way one doesn't need to use a .jbuilder view other view or series of code lines in their API to display updated data the default respondwith command will just do it for them.A note I had the added line respond to both PATCH and PUT just in case but I can also imagine why you might want it to just be PATCH at this point.

Make the isolated tests run on JRuby;HelloThis pull request make the tests correctly run in isolation for JRuby. As there is no forking on JRuby we need to spawn subprocesses to make the tests run in isolation.Previously we were defining globally env variables and running the test file through backticks and delete these variables once the test ran.Now we simply rely on IO.popen as this is crossplatform and the env variables are available during the childprocess execution only so there are no race conditions.Thus we no longer get ArgumentError marshal data too short when running rake testisolated. The only drawback we can see is that since we are using Process.wait on computers with a tiny CPU the test suite is bit slower to run.Most of the work have been done by Ben here by the wayHave a nice day.

close Don't output to STDOUT twice;When rails console or rails server are used along with a logger set to output to STDOUT then the contents will show up twice. This happens because the logger is extended with ActiveSupportLogger.broadcast with a destination of STDOUT even if it is already outputting to STDOUT.Previously PR attempted to fix this issue but it ended up causing NoMethodErrors. A better approach than relying on adding a method and flow control is to inspect the log destination directly. For this ActiveSupportLogger.loggeroutputsto was introducedlogger Logger.newSTDOUTActiveSupportLogger.loggeroutputstologger STDOUT trueTo accomplish this we must look inside of an instance variable of standard lib's Logger logdev.

Add types to ActiveRecordStore accessors;SummaryActiveRecordStore is awesome but it doesn't have any support for casting types.

Add tophits aggregation;The tophits aggregator keeps track of the most relevant document being aggregated. This aggregator should be used as a sub aggregator of a bucket based aggregator so that the top documents per bucket are computed.Via this aggregator grouping field collapsing can be achieved and is very versatile. Someone can group by a field using a terms aggregator as parent or by time using a histogram aggregator as parent in any case the parent bucket aggregator determines how to group. How correct the top hits will depend on the parent aggregator. For example when using the terms aggregator and the tophits aggregator some document may not end up in the response because the shardsize on the terms aggregator is less then the field's cardinality.The tophits aggregator should have the following optionssize The amount of hits to collect.sort Defines how the top hits should be sorted.and any other fetch phase options. Like source filtering and highlighting.The prototype that is attached right now to this PR integrates nicely with the fetch phase which allows all fetch like features to be implemented easily.

Add infrastructure to transactionally apply and reset dynamic settings;This commit adds the infrastructure to make settings that are updateableresetable and changes the application of updates to be transactional. This meanssetting updates are either applied or not. If the application failes all values are rejected.This initial commit converts all dynamic cluster settings to make use of the new infrastructure.All cluster level dynamic settings are not resettable to their defaults or to the node level settings.The infrastructure also allows to list default values and descriptions which is not fully implemented yet.Values can be reset using a list of key or simple regular expressions. This has only been implemented on the javalayer yet. For instance to reset all recovery settings to their defaults a user can just specify indices.recovery..This commit also adds strict settings validation if a setting is unknown or if a setting can not be applied the entiresettings update request will fail.

Expand wildcards to closed indices in catindices;Closed indices are already displayed when no indices are explicitly selected. This commit ensures that closed indices are also shown when wildcard filtering is used fixes . It also addresses another issue that is caused by the fact that the cat action is based internally on different cluster states one when we query the cluster state to get all indices one when we query cluster health and one when we query indices stats. We currently fail the cat request when the user specifies a concrete index as parameter that does not exist. The implementation works as intended in that regard. It checks this not only for the first cluster state request but also the subsequent indices stats one. This means that if the index is deleted before the cat action has queried the indices stats it rightfully fails. In case the user provides wildcards or no parameter at all however we fail the indices stats as we pass the resolved concrete indices to the indices stats request and fail to distinguish whether these indices have been resolved by wildcards or explicitly requested by the user. This means that if an index has been deleted before the indices stats request gets to execute we fail the overall cat request see . The fix is to let the indices stats request do the resolving again and not pass the concrete indices.Closes Closes        The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered

Die cwd die;See for reference.Currently some code looks in CWD and places like user.home for configuration files in a confusing way in some cases even overriding other paths so if you have a stray elasticsearch.yml there good luck.Tests hide the problem because they add too many permissions. We fixed that here and then all tests were failing and made hacky changes to get tests passing again.So some of the changes here can be cleaned up solved differently. For example we could look for the custom hunspell data directory in Environment grant access to it and deprecate it instead of throwing an error. But with what is here all tests pass so I think we know enough to discuss so we can move forward.       The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered

Add date math support in index names;Date math index name resolution enables you to search a range of timeseries indices rather than searching all of your timeseries indices and filtering the the results or maintaining aliases.

We don't use offsetLeft but instead we calculate thevarious buttons widths. In the common case where we only have the action buttonwe don't even take the current width and assume it's px which eliminates apossible reflow.Additionally we now support the start end and nofontfit arguments.start end allows the component user to gives the leftright button sizes tothe component which effectively eliminates all reflows.nofontfit when this attribute is present we skip all font resizing algorithmand thus no reflow. This allows to defer some initialization and reflow for the headersthat are not displayed at startup.Last but not least now we try to squeeze the font fit for centered titles beforeuncentering them.

allow registered vars in playbook to be dynamic;A colleague of mine ran into the problem that registered variables were not being overwritten properly when running a role multiple times on the same host for multiple users. name foo test command usrbintest e home user  register foo failedwhen false changedwhen false name foo echo command usrbinecho HOME EXISTS when foo.rc I wasn't able to diagnose whether this is intended or not or what to do about it.

ecelbfacts Handle AWS throttling when requesting ELB information;SUMMARYFixes issue where module would fail immediately upon encountering AWS API throttling.Also makes minor changes to error handling.ISSUE TYPEBugfix Pull RequestCOMPONENT NAMEecelbfacts.pyANSIBLE VERSIONansible ... config file  configured module search path Default wo overridesADDITIONAL INFORMATIONUses the AWSRetry.backoff method both as a decorator and where more efficient directly as a wrapper function to handle AWS API throttling for boto methods invoked in the module.Various instances of BotoServerError exceptions being caught and handled simply by invoking the failjson method have been removed and replaced with a similar trycatch block in the main function. I'm not sure that this exception handling was particularly useful in the first place and I'd be open to removing it completely but moving it into main at least provides pretty much equivalent behavior without interfering with use of the AWSRetry decorator which can handle specific cases of BotoServerError.Also removes questionable 'catchall' clause on line which would return an empty dict for tags.

Inject the active user into JAdminCssMenu;Summary of ChangesCalls to Joomla\CMS\FactorygetUser without specifying the user ID i.e. to get the currently logged in user are expensive because this always ends up calling Joomla\CMS\Session\Sessionget. In the admin modmenu we repetitively call this method to do ACL checks on menu items in the JAdminCssMenu class. We can make a microoptimization of the module's performance by injecting the user we're getting in the module's main file when instantiating this class.Therefore this PR changes the module to inject that user instance and for BC this constructor argument is optional until ..You can review the call graph comparison at httpsblackfire.ioprofilescompareecafccegraph to see how many fewer calls there are as a result which also creates a small performance enhancement.Testing InstructionsWith the patch applied navigate the backend. The admin menu is correctly assembled.
Only get config and user from factory when needed in JHtmldate;Partial Pull Request for Issue Summary of ChangesCalls to Joomla\CMS\FactorygetUser with no arguments end up in a call to Joomla\CMS\Session\Sessionget so this isn't a highly performant method call and should only happen when needed. In Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelperdate it is only needed in one of the four conditions so there is no need to always call this method. Likewise Joomla\CMS\FactorygetConfig only needs to be called in one of the four conditions. So stop arbitrarily calling these two methods on every call to Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelperdate and only call them when actually needed.Testing InstructionsWith the patch applied datetime strings are still correctly localized.

Don't generate links for action logs CSV export;Summary of ChangesAs suggested in this skips generating links for the action log messages since they aren't going to be used in most export formats anyway and in fact the CSV export helper has a striptags call. This offers a memory boost by not having to go through the router after the memory issues identified in .A Blackfire graph can be reviewed at httpsblackfire.ioprofilescomparefceedabbbfgraph note that the increased number of Joomla\CMS\Language\Text and ActionlogsHelpergetHumanReadableLogMessage calls is actually because more log messages are being included in my exports the first request in the comparison is actually reaching my second timeout after rows while with this patch I'm now over rows before the timeout is reachedTesting InstructionsWith the patch applied the action logs CSV file should still be exported. If you're profiling the request you should note a decrease in memory use and depending on how large of an export you're working with probably an increase in row count.

Batch Change State pass only affected items to table and event;Summary of ChangesWhen you currently change the state of items published unpublished trashed...in the list via inline or toolbar button joomla does not care about the current state of the item.This affects the notification x items published... and more importantly it also affects the primary keys that are passed to the onContentChangeState event it passes all primary keys of all selected items including the ones where the state did not change. A plugin that listens to this event has no possibility to check if i.e. an article was unpublished before because the value in db already changed.After these changes we pass only the pks that really should bechanged to the table and plugin event. If there are no items to change we respond with a success message items published.Because we already load the item no additional query is needed.Testing InstructionsGo to article Manager set one article as unpublished.Checkall articles and publish them.As the change was made in ArticleModel this will affect all Models in the backend that are extending it. So it would be good to test other entities as well.Before ChangesAfter ChangesWhen no items were published

fixorderBy ensure correct ordering with arrays of objects and no predicate;This fix also considerably refactors how the orderBy filter works in internally.The new algorithm precomputes the predicate values for the array being ordered. This makes the algorith easier to follow but also ensures that this computation is done a maximum of n times whereas in the previous algorithm it could be greater. The downside is that we must temporarily store this intermediate array.There could be performance implications but they are as likely to be beneficial as detrimental. It could probably do with benchmarking.Closes

fixngModel don't run parsers when executing validate;Previously validate would execute the parsers to obtain amodelValue for validation. This was necessary because a validatorthat is called outside of model view update e.g. from an observerotherwise might only an undefined modelValue because a previousview update has found a validation error and set the modelto undefined as is tradition in angularThis is problematic as validators that are run immediately afterthe ngModelController initializes would parse the modelValueand replace the model even though there had been no user input.The solution is to go back to an older design the ngModelControllerwill now internally record the rawModelValue. This means a modelor view update will store the set parsed modelValue regardlessof validity that is it will never set it to undefined because ofvalidation errors.When validate is called the rawModelValue will passed to thevalidators. If the validity has changed the usual behavior is keptif it became invalid set the model to undefined if validrestore the last available modelValue the rawModelValue.Additionally validate will only update the model when the validitychanged. This is to prevent setting initially invalid models otherthan undefined to undefined see Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Closes Closes Closes Bonus the commit which introduced parsing when validating I actually wanted invalidModelValue to be removed oh well addcaitp petebacondarwin lgalfaso

Remove flex from rows;Looking some recent grid changes I think the best option is to revert the latest tweaks and make some isolated improvements rather than the global row and container changes.Here's a rundown of what got us to todayShipped responsive containers in and w v...Added minwidth to .col to prevent some broken columns in which closed .Shipped to fix which reverted the above minwidth change.Shipped to fix which added flex to .rows so they didn't shrink if the parent was a flex container. This problem stemmed from v.. where navbar container was changed due to responsive containers. This caused .Shipped to dedupe our container classes in our generated CSS which also removed a mixin instead of deprecating it. This was a breaking change.We've already removed the minwidth in v.. so that's covered. The last step is to undo the flex on .rows and get us back to our stable grid in v. This is causing the problem reported in . Unsetting flex fixes the issue so that's why this PR removes the line entirely.The workaround for the pre element in the columns is to add minwidth to help flex layout shrink past the content's size. This is documented at httpsstackoverflow.comquestionswhydontflexitemsshrinkpastcontentsize. There's also a demo of this in the CodePen below. restores the makecontainermaxwidths mixin fixing our backward compatibility issue.Adding .flexfill to the .row in our navbars fixes the issue with the row not taking up the full width of the parent container that has display flex. This addresses properly. We could add custom styles to the navbar's rows but that just sounds like it'd perpetuate the issue here.This demos hows all issues and changes at httpscodepen.ioemdeohpenLYNYmPReditors.Fixes closes .My plan is to have us ship a v.. to fix the breaking change in and this PR to undo the grid changes and restabilize v's grid system.
Restore and deprecate makecontainermaxwidths mixin;We removed this to dedupe our grid containers in our compiled CSS see and I wasn't thinking when reviewing that it'd be a breaking change. We're sticking with not using the mixin but adding the mixin back for others to use.We may need to add a deprecation notice to it as well.Fixes fixes

BUGFIX lts Makes user helper computation lazy instead of eager;From .. the behavior of certain helpers was slightly different.Essentially if we detected that the arguments to the helper wereconstant we would eagerly run the helper to determine if it wasconstant. If it was constant we would then not have to update thehelper.This was a bit mistaken because as we realized later on when we fullyconverted the VM to use autotracking we cannot eagerly detect ifarguments are constant in all cases. The solution was to have a systemwhich would convert cached values to be constant if no autotrackedvalues were detected during the first computation whenever thatoccured.Unfortunately in the affected versions helpers sometimes run eagerlywhen previously they would not. This PR fixes that for user helperswhich could contain bugs if they ran eagerly when they previouslyran lazily.Fixes        The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered
BUGFIX release Avoid instantiation errors when approuter.js injects the router service.;Related to my previous PR And issue rwjblue Since we talked about this with snewcomer recently maybe you can weigh in on this approachThe intention is to prevent an infinite recursion when servicerouter is invoked before routermain has a chance to be initialized and cached. This PR does it by making servicerouter more passive so that the responsibility of forwarding routeWillChange and routeDidChange events is handled by routermain as opposed to looking upand possibly instantiating routermain and listening to events on it from servicerouter. The active behavior of servicerouter instantiating routermain seems unexpected and doesn't appear to be required in any tests.Specifically the servicerouter has been changed to only use routermain if it's already available and routermain now forwards those two route events to servicerouter if that service has been instantiated. That way there's no possibility of getting caught in a loop if servicerouter happens to be used during initialization of routermain which can happen unexpectedly when using a service from an addon that references servicerouter.Definitely open to any kind of feedback.

BUGFIX Ensure entries are properly defined on loader;Ensures the registry field on Ember.loader is setup properly andthat the shim loader has entries defined on it correctly.
BUGFIX lts Force building Ember bundles when targets.node is defined;This is my first attempt at fixing the issue described in This does not follow pzuraq's recommendation in comment because it would essentially mean that the prebuilt dev bundle would have Node v as the lowest common denominator for all modern browser features which means that we will not be able to make use of native optional chaining until Node v is EOL in April and going forward this is likely going to cause the dev bundles to be a little bit behind constantlyInstead this is opting out of using the prebuilt bundle when you have node current or really anything listing node in your targets file. This will obviously make the build slower for anyone using fastboot but really we need to make a decision here because the current outofthe box fastboot experience is very broken since optional chaining was added to the ember.js codebase e.g. httpsgithub.comemberjsember.jsblobv..packagesemberinternalsruntimelibmixinsarray.jsL Let me know if you have any questions

It generates valid href ifsetupRouter is called and complete model are passed for dynamicsegments.In our previous changes we removed the requirement to callsetupRouter and always return empty href when initial transition isnot started. This is not expected when passing complete dynamic segmentswithout initial transition.Test doneI linked the fix and superrentalstutorials pass test

Refactor the internal Ember loader to use the standard Ember CLI loader;This PR refactors the internal Ember loader so that it uses the standardEmber CLI loader instead for modules. This means that modules will bedefined in the main namespace and importable from there instead of ina hidden namespace that only Ember can use.NotesCode is still loaded and built via treeForVendor and included as avendor file. This needs to be the case for the time being forbootstrapping.Loader code is still included for Node support. If define andrequire are not already defined then a backup shim is used instead.Modules are now exposed from Ember but emberclibabel stilltranspiles them to global references. This unblocks us from being ableto make all modules work normally however.require shim module is no longer defined we reference define andrequire as globals instead which is more accurate. In the futurewe should update this to use Embroider's conventions.loader is still exposed on the Ember object referencing the samevalues as before.

CLEANUP Refactor DataAdapter to not use observers or array observers;The DataAdapter class is exposed specifically for the Ember Inspector tosupport Ember Data. Currently the adapter relies on both arrayobservers and standard observers. This PR refactors the adapter to useautotrackingbased methods for tracking changes instead with minimalAPI churn.The main change is to introduce a regular poll that checks for changesafter each backburner runloop. There are two types of polling doneTypeWatcher which checks to see if a record array has changed atall e.g. contents have changedRecordsWatcher which watches the array as a whole and theindividual records within it. Whenever any changes occur itreiterates the records array and looks for new records updatedrecords and removed records and notifies of any changes.This removes the need for both array observers and standard observers.Standard observers were previously used to detect changes on the modelinstances but now we autotrack serializing them and thatautotracking is used to detect if they've been updated. Breaking ChangesThe recordsRemoved callback from watchRecords has changed. It nowreceives an array of removed records not an index and count. On theconsuming side in Ember Inspector we'll have to update the code toremove the items passed via id explicitly.The observeRecord method has been removed. Because serializing theobject is observing it via autotracking there is no need tomanually observe it. Users who are still implementing this methode.g. Ember Data can still keep it and it shouldn't cause issues itjust will no longer be called.

jsonplan Add replacepaths;The set of paths which caused a resource update to require replacement has been stored in the plan since .. . This commit adds a simple JSON representation of these paths allowing consumers of this format to determine exactly which paths caused the resource to be replaced.This representation is intentionally more loosely encoded than the JSON state serialization of paths used for sensitive attributes. Instead of a path step being represented by an object with type and value we use a moreJavaScripty heterogenous array of numbers and strings. Any practical consumer of this format will likely traverse an object tree using the index operator which should work more easily with this format. It also allows easy prefix comparison for consumers which are tracking paths.While updating the documentation to include this new field I noticed that some others were missing so added them too.This is the last missing piece of the JSON plan format that I'm aware of so we might want to bump the output format to . soon.

Validate passing default providers through modules;Add validation for the local side of the providers map assignments in module calls. If these did not actually correspond to a configuration during runtime the user would be presented with a missing provider error with the assumed address of the provider but no indication how to configure that address. We can detect these during validation and present a much more precise error Warning No configuration passed in for provider aws in module.mod on modmain.tf line in module mod aws.local aws Provider aws is referenced within module.mod but no configuration has been supplied. Add a provider named aws to the providers map for module.mod in the root module.It was also assumed that inherited providers could be referenced within modules which is understandable because resources effectively do the same. This inheritance does not work in module calls however because the provider is looked up in the next child module one level removed from the inherited provider. Rather than rework inheritance to account for this edge case we can direct users to create a more explicit configuration by declaring the name within the module so that we can follow up with the above recommendation if no configuration is presented. Warning Provider aws is undefined on modmain.tf line in module mod aws.local aws No provider named aws has been declared in module.mod. If you wish to refer to the aws provider within the module add a provider configuration  or an entry in the requiredproviders block.Fixes        The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered

command New replace... planning option;This allows a similar effect to pretainting an object but does the action within the context of a normal plan and apply avoiding the need for an intermediate state where the old object still exists but is marked as tainted.terraform plan replacenullresource.blahterraform apply replacenullresource.blahThe core functionality for this was already present from so this commit is just the UIlevel changes to make that option available for use and to explain how it contributed to the resulting plan in Terraform's output. It does include one little tweak to the corelevel implementation to respond to some error reporting feedback I deferred in .As with instances that are marked as tainted in the prior state an instance that is forced for replacement gets a special annotation in the plan to acknowledge that this replace was in response to an explicit user request rather than in response to tainting or as directed by the provider.Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols destroy and then create replacementTerraform will perform the following actions nullresource.blah will be replaced as requested resource nullresource blah  id known after apply Plan to add to change to destroy.The source information needed to replicate that special annotation in another external UI was already included in the terraform show json plan output as part of so there's no additional work for that here.

website Reworking of the terraform plan docs and related pages;It's been a long time since we gave this page an overhaul and with our ongoing efforts to make plan and apply incorporate all of the sideeffects that might need to be done against a configuration it seems like a good time for some restructuring in that vein.The starting idea here is to formally split the many terraform plan options into a few different categoriesPlanning modesPlanning optionsOther optionsThe planning modes and options are the subset that are also accepted by terraform apply when it's running in its default mode of generating a plan and then prompting for interactive approval of it. This then allows us to avoid duplicating all of that information on the terraform apply page and thus allows us to spend more words discussing each of them.This set of docs is intended as a fresh start into which we'll be able to more surgically add in the information about refreshonly and replace... once we have those implemented. Consequently there are some parts of this which may seem a little overwrought for what it's currently describing that's a result of my having prepared this by just deleting the refreshonly and replace... content from our initial docs draft and submitted the result in anticipation of readding the parts I've deleted here in the very near future in other commits.This does include some additions that catch up with some changes in that weren't documented yetterraform apply destroy is now a thing for symmetry with terraform plan destroy and later on both with refreshonly.Our help output for various commands changed to match with the restructuring I made to the docs here where terraform apply help is more explicit that it's effectively running terraform plan internally and so to go look at the plan docs for information on modes and options.

core Internal implementation of the refresh only planning mode and replace planning option;This PR adds the internal handling of what will eventually become the refreshonly and replaceADDR options when creating a plan. There's not yet any UIlevel code to activate these two so for the moment these are just dead code from an enduser perspective but I want to land these parts first and then iterate separately on how to present the effects of these in the UI since I expect that'll be a more subjective discussion with more tradeoffs to weigh.For refresh onlyat the lowest level of abstraction inside the graph nodes themselves this effectively mirrors the existing option to disable refreshing with a new option to disable changeplanning so that either half of the process can be disabled. As far as the nodes are concerned it would be possible in principle to disable both but the higherlevel representation of these modes prevents that combination from reaching Terraform Core in practice because we block activating both skip refresh and the refreshonly planning mode at the same time when creating a context.The forcereplace option is ultimately handled inside the NodeAbstractResourceInstance.plan method in the same place we handle the similar situation of the provider indicating that replacement is needed and so the rest of the changes here are just to propagate the settings through all of the layers in order to reach that point. The only externallyvisible difference in the result between those two situations is the new ActionReason field we added earlier in which we'll use in a later commit to describe this situation differently when we present the planned changes to the user.This also introduces a new Mode field for plans which records which mode was active when the plan was created. As with ActionReason in the earlier PR this is something we'd intentionally excluded so far in fear of it becoming a loadbearing part of the planapply process but our later UI work here will need to include an explanation in the UI for why a refreshonly plan doesn't plan to change anything and so having core report that out rather than replicating similar logic in the UI layer again seems preferable to ensure that these will always stay aligned over time as the rules might change. This field is explicitly documented as for presentation only since the details in the Changes object should always be totally sufficient to correctly execute the apply step the plan mode just affects what sort of actions Terraform might include in the plan not how those chosen actions are to be executed.Since these two changes have some toplevel overlap but are otherwise in different parts of the core package it might be easier to review them on a percommit basis.

plans Track an optional extra reason for some planned actions;Previously we were repeating some logic in the UI layer in order to recover relevant additional context about a change to report to a user. In order to help keep things consistent and to have a clearer path for adding more such things in the future here we capture this userfacing idea of an action reason within the plan model and then use that directly in order to decide how to describe the change to the user.We previously resisted including this because it's arguably a UI concern rather than a core concern it doesn't provide sufficient detail to make applytime decisions based on it and so we always include other information in the change objects to allow us to make the same decisions during apply as we did during plan. However it doesn't seem sustainable to keep replicating all of the reason decisions in both the UI layer and in the core layer so this is a compromise where the core layer decides which highlevel reason to indicate but the UI is still responsible for describing it to the user. The comments inline indicate that this is not to be used for anything other than presenting information to the user.For the moment the tainted situation is the only one that gets a special message matching what we had before but we can expand on this in future in order to give better feedback about the other replace situations too.To avoid churn in the plan file format implementation this also preemptively includes the replacing by request reason which is currently not reachable but will be used in the near future as part of implementing the replace... plan command line option to allow forcing a particular object to be replaced.So far we don't have any special reasons for anything other than replacing which makes some sense because replacing is the only one that is in a sense a special case of another action Update but this could expand to other kinds of reasons in the future such as indicating which of the few different reasons a data source read might be deferred until the apply step.

Generalize the idea of a plan mode vs just destroy flag;Previously there were only two planning modes normal mode and destroy mode. In that context it made sense for these to be distinguished only by a boolean flag.We're now getting ready to add our third mode refresh only. This establishes the idea that planning can be done in one of a number of mutuallyexclusive modes which are related to but separate from the various other options that serve as modifiers for the plan operation.This commit only introduces the new plans.Mode type and replaces the existing destroy flag fields with a field of that type. This doesn't cause any change in effective behavior because Terraform Core still supports only NormalMode and DestroyMode with NewContext rejecting an attempt to create a RefreshMode context for now and the CLI layer having no codepath that tries to set it.It is in retrospect a little odd that the destroy flag was part of ContextOpts rather than just an argument to the Plan method but refactoring that would be too invasive a change for right now so we'll leave this as a field of the context for now and save revisiting that for another day.For this PR I've just peeled off the first two commits from . These two just change internal implementation details of how we represent destroy mode without adding any new functionality. I want to land these first and early because they are crosscutting and thus likely to come into conflict with other work if they were part of a longlived feature branch.With these in place the remaining work should involve more localized commits that we can land without necessarily colliding with other work in other subsystems.I've marked this for backport primarily because otherwise it seems likely that other unrelated backports to v. will end up failing due to this being a crosscutting change. However it also seems likely that at least parts of the planned functionality for refreshonly plans will also land in the v. branch and so this backport will support that.

buffer add Buffer.harden method;This is a strawperson currently targeted at resolving Buffer controversies and providing an alternate safer Buffer API that could be opted in from the top level app code. This should both resolve potential concerns about Buffer unsafety that are otherwise nonresolvable in general for performance reasons and give ecosystem another nudge to migrate off unsafe deprecated Bufferarg API.This adds Buffer.harden method thatEnsures all new buffers are zerofilled even from Buffer.allocUnsafe similar to zerofillbuffers CLI flag.Ensures that pooling is permanently disabled.Enables runtime deprecation for deprecated BufferargFreezes Buffer object.That method is callable only from the toplevel app it will throw when called from dependencies reuses already existing isInsideNodeModules check for that.Example Buffer.allocUnsafeBuffer  Buffer.from'sdfds'.bufferArrayBuffer  UintContents ff ff ff ff a ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ... more bytes byteLength  Buffer.hardenundefined Buffer.allocUnsafeBuffer  Buffer.from'sdfds'.bufferArrayBuffer UintContents byteLength UnresolvedReevaluating Buffer module could create nonhardened BuffersChild process Buffers are non hardened I thought about going into those by an env var but let's keep that out of scopecc nodejssecuritywg nodejssecurity nodejsbuffer mafintosh commentsChecklist make j test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes tests andor benchmarks are included documentation is changed or added commit message follows commit guidelines

Fix read parquet import error message;closes  tests added passed passes black pandas passes git diff upstreammaster u .py | flake diff whatsnew entry NApandas.io.parquet.getengine uses handling of ImportErrors for flow control to decide which parquet reader engine is used. In doing so it quashed lowerlevel error messages that would have been helpful to the user attempting to diagnose the error replacing it with a misleading error message.I refactored the error handling allowing for these lowerlevel error messages to be collected and explicitly bubbled up. Thus fixing the incorrect error message.No tests added this behaviour is not worthy of testing. Presumably not worthy of a whatsnew entry either.
PERF improve IntegerArray fast constructor;Trying to improve the IntegerArray constructor from its constituents.Example test casea pd.array dtypeIntvalues a.datamask a.mask pd.arrays.IntegerArrayvalues maskIn timeit pd.arrays.IntegerArrayvalues mask . ?s ? . ns per loop mean ? std. dev. of runs loops each master ns ? . ns per loop mean ? std. dev. of runs loops each PRSo what is in the PR is one possible solution to show the impact of using general dtype checking functions that eg also need to deal with EA dtypes getting the dtype of values being passed etc. It is clear that here we can do a much more specialized check and that this gives a considerable performance boost in eg blockcolumnwise operations on IntegerArray this is reconstructed many times. Some optionsdo an inline specialized check as done heredefine separate helper functions for those specialized checks eg restricting to numpy dtypesimprove performance of isbooldtype isintegerdtype for those cases maybe putting a check like this as a fastpath at the beginning of those functions might avoid more costly checks done in those functions for this specific case eg isboolnpdtypesimply don't do any validation at all in the IntegerArray constructor and assume this is the responsibility of the callerprovide a keyword in the IntegerArray constructor to turn off validationadd a private constructor similar as the simplenew we have for others that uses this fastpathFor optimal performance having a way to don't do any validation at all so also don't check the passed values are ndarray or their dtypes would actually even be better than what this PR does. But I also like the clean constructor we have now eg no separate private constructor

Don't pass a Fiber to showErrorDialog;There are two places where we create CapturedError.

Adds semver to the package dev dependencies;This diff simply adds semver to the toplevel dev dependencies. Semver was used in various scripts ex here without being listed which was invalid it worked because one of React's dependencies was itself depending on semver which was then hoisted to the toplevel through package managers optimizations.

Expanded DEVonly warnings for gDSFP and legacy lifecycles;After a lot of discussion and careful consideration the team has reaffirmed the initial decision to not call unsafe legacy lifecycles componentWillMount componentWillReceiveProps and componentWillUpdate for any component that defines the new static getDerivedStateFromProps lifecycle. This applies to the UNSAFE aliases as well.The reason for this decision ultimately boils down to support for the reactlifecyclescompat polyfill and concerns about consistent predictable behavior for future version of React.As jquense pointed out with issue conditional lifecycle behavior is a new thing and it is not intuitive. For this reason we needed to improve the granularity and wording of the DEV warning. This PR does that first by expanding the warning conditionals to explicitly check for componentWillMount and componentWillUpdate as well rather than just componentWillReceiveProps and secondly by explicitly stating that Unsafe legacy lifecycles will not be called for components using the new getDerivedStateFromProps API.The entire new DEV warning isUnsafe legacy lifecycles will not be called for components using the new getDerivedStateFromProps API.YourComponentName uses getDerivedStateFromProps but also contains the following legacy lifecycles componentWillMount componentWillReceiveProps componentWillUpdateThe above lifecycles should be removed. Learn more about this warning herehttpsfb.mereactasynccomponentlifecyclehooksTests have been updated as well to verify the new behavior.Resolves

Functionality remains the same code is also more legible and the loop performs faster this way so there are multiple benefits to doing it this way.

New commit phase lifecycle getSnapshotBeforeUpdate;Add new commit phase lifecycle getSnapshotBeforeUpdate that gets called before mutations are made. Any value returned by this lifecycle will be passed as the third parameter to componentDidUpdate.This lifecycle is important for async rendering where there may be delays between render phase lifecycles e.g. componentWillUpdate and render and commit phase lifecycles e.g. componentDidUpdate.This PR follows the precedent set by getDerivedStateFromProps and does not call unsafe legacy lifecycles componentWillMount componentWillReceiveProps or componentWillUpdate for any component that defines the new getSnapshotBeforeUpdate method. This is not strictly necessary unless we decide to polyfill the new method see reactjsreactlifecyclescompatpull but I think it may still be a good thing to do for consistency.Likewise it does not log warnings for componentWillUpdate if a suppressDeprecationWarning flag is present.If others disagree I can remove this specific part of the PR aka revert eda and .Relates to reactjsrfcspull view formatted.

Unify context stack implementations;Implements the new context API on top of the existing ReactStack that we already use for host context and legacy context. Now there is a single array that we push and pop from.This makes the interrupt path slightly slower since when we reset the unit of work pointer we have to iterate over the stack like before and switch on the type of work not like before. On the other hand this unifies all of the unwinding behavior in the UnwindWork module.Also changes the context modules to use module constructors so that each renderer gets a separate instance which is currently broken when using reactreconciler.This is not a total unification of legacy context and the new context API. A further step would be to implement the legacy contextTypesbased API on top of React.createContext.

The goal was to come up with a definition that would be in line with the two papers from which these classes have been implemented. While LinearSVC LinearSVR use Liblinear which calls C a penalty parameter SVC SVR use Libsvm which labels C as a regularization parameter. I have tried to come up with a definition that is consistent with both of these papers mainly Penalty or regularization parameter strictly positive that is inversely  proportional to the regularization strength and is multiplied to the  loss term of the cost function.Any other commentsIssue also talks about editing the User Guide to clarify the different losses versus the different regularization norms being used. I feel that this discussion is beyond the scope of this issue and could be addressed with the creation of another more specific issue.AcknowledgementsThanks to WiMLDS for holding the Sprint event and neginkrahbar.

Add support for WebGL uniform array operations;Adds support for the WebGL overloads of uniformifv.WebGL adds two optional parameters for the uniformifv functions to allow specifying input data ranges. However because they have the same name and overlapping parameters the Codegen cannot make a difference between their GL and variants. As a workaround I've added the new parameters to the WebGL side which which isn't strictly what the spec says but shouldn't break things either.

Put target element form owner and element document on scope chain of compiled events;Event listeners that are created from a function object just get whatever closure the function object had but event listeners created from a string need a special closure that acts like they were defined inside a series of with statements.

The existing WPT test for it htmlwebappapisscriptingeventscompileeventhandlerlexicalscopes.html also relies on other behavior we don't have so I added an easier version of the test that doesn't involve bubbling or capturing and doesn't check any IDL properties we don't have.

Fix invalid yaml;Because deprecated 'The aliasid alias is deprecated. Don\'t use it anymore.' is not valid Yaml it leads to this errorOK All YAML files contain valid syntax.Unexpected characters near t use it anymore.The yaml specification saysAll nonprintable characters must be escaped. YAML escape sequences use the ?Ç£\?Ç¥ notation common to most modern computer languages. Each escape sequence must be parsed into the appropriate Unicode character. The original escape sequence is a presentation detail and must not be used to convey content information.Note that escape sequences are only interpreted in doublequoted scalars. In all other scalar styles the ?Ç£\?Ç¥ character has no special meaning and nonprintable characters are not available.So I think removing the ' will help users who copy the configuration from the documentation.

Removed Translation component documentation;While translation is one of the components that is used by other applications quite a lot most of the components docs was about general translator usage that also applies to usage in the framework.

Much of this was duplicated in both so that proves that this move is a usefull thing to do. articles have been completely removed Creating your custom message formatter and format. A custom message formatter seems really advanced usage. The Translation component provides so many formats that I think creating a custom format is also quite advanced. If it turns out this is not true we can rest assured that they still exist in GIT history so we can quickly add them back.Please note that the main translator guide is a really ugly structured document. However let's only do the rewriting in Symfony . as lots has changed flex ICU message format etc between .x and .x.

ServiceManagercanCreateFromAbstractFactory missing foreach break after valid abstract factory found;It seems that in the ServiceManagercanCreateFromAbstractFactoryMethod is missing foreach break after an abstract factory is found and assigned to the nestedContext.Missing break after httpsgithub.comzendframeworkzfblobdeveloplibraryZendServiceManagerServiceManager.phpLNow the issue is that the first abstract factory if can create a service is always overridden with the last abstract factory that can create the same service e.g. DiAbstractServiceFactory.For example I add an abstract factory to the service manager config AdapterAbstractServiceFactory and I configure the db adapter. When I want to inject that adapter with the Di I have to configure the di instance alias. But when the service manager is creating that db adapter new instance it continues over the AdapterAbstractServiceFactory to the DiAbstractServiceFactory because of that missing foreach break. Thus db adapter instance can't be created
Soap\Client\DotNetFIX Undefined property in void return;The dotNet soap implementation send the result in a LastRequestResult xml node so the DotNet preProcessResult return directly this node.But in some case when the method return nothing and if this behaviour is not defined in the ws defition wsdl for example a notice error is raised because the searched node does not exists.So I have added an exists condition on the LastRequestResult xml node to avoid this error.The code is not unittested because I don't know how to test this peculiar behaviour but the modification is really really tiny.
SoapServer add debug mode;When an exception is raised the \Zend\Soap\Server catch it and check if this is an authorized exception.If not and for security reason it send an Unknow error message.And if in production its a sane behaviour its really annoying during development tests process.So I propose to add a setDebugMode method when activated send all exceptions to the client.The code is unittested.

Adding Zend\Console\Getopt option callback hooks;Based on some todo annotations present in this class I've added the ability to use callbacks when options are parsed. This feature addresses several of these todo annotations. Triggering callbacks for options when presentYou can now trigger a callback for any option that is present. For example suppose you wish to trigger a callback when the option apples is passed either by it's short form a or by it's alias apple. Here is how you could do thisopts new Getoptarray 'a|apple|appless' 'Specify a type of apple you want to eat.'optssetOptionCallback'apple' functionvalue echo You want a value appleAs soon as you call optsparse the callback will be called assuming you passed a Gala appleGala or applesGala on the command line. Furthermore the value Gala will be passed by value to the first callback parameter. Invalidating usage by returning falseUsing a callback you can return false to indicate that there is an issue with the way an option was used. Perhaps there is a dependance on some other value that must be present. For exampleopts new Getoptarray 'fruit|fs' 'The kind of fruit you would like to eat.' 'a|apple|appless' 'Specify a type of apple you want to eat.'optssetOptionCallback'fruit' functionvalue opts if value  technically optional so return return  if value 'apple'  echo You like this kind of fruit value. return  if value 'apple' null apple optsgetOption'apple'  return false you could also just throw a Exception\RuntimeException here too if you want more specificity  echo You like apples specifically apple.Notice that you can specify a nd argument to the callback which is the instance of Getopt you're currently working with. This allows you to check on other command line parameters should you need to.This also accomplishes conditionally required parameters from the command line. Here both options are technically optional but specifying fruitapple will trigger the apple requirement. You can use callbacks to accomplish conditional logic in this manner.Other todo requestsHandle flags that implicitly print usage message e.g. help this can easily be accomplished using a callback. Since Getopt class should never be dealing without output the way to deal with this would be to attach a callback that throws the Exeption\RuntimeException method with the usage information. You can then use exception handling to print out the error message in the existing error handling for console appstry  opts new Getopt params  optssetOptionCallback'help' functionval opts throw new Exception\RuntimeException'Usage' optsgetUsageMessage  optsparse catch Exception\RuntimeException e  echo egetMessage . PHPEOL echo egetUsageMessage exitEnable user to specify header and footer content in the help message. This class does not deal with output. The previous example could simply add headerfooter information to the printing of the exception message and usage message wherever appropriate. This would simply be the programmers choice.Excerpt of class doc block  todo Handle flags that implicitly print usage message e.g. help  todo Enable user to specify header and footer content in the help message.  todo Feature request to handle option interdependencies. e.g. if b is specified a must be specified or else the usage is invalid.  todo Feature request to implement callbacks. e.g. if a is specified run function 'handleOptionA'.
Implemented writeTextBlock method in Zend\Console\Adapter\AbstractAdapter;I noticed that the Zend\Console\Adapter\AbstractAdapterwriteTextBlock method was not implemented so I implemented it added tests and ran phpcsfixer.Also in order to be able to verify how this method writes data I added an array to the test asset class ConsoleAdapter. Without this tracking array the output buffering doesn't correctly show which data I expect since there isn't a way to track text in between calls to AbstractAdaptersetPos.

Use strings.Index instead of strings.Split;Since we don't need the actual split values instead of callingstrings.Split which allocates new slices on each call usestrings.Index.This significantly reduces the allocations required when doing env valuereplacements.Additionally preallocate the env var slice even if we allocate alittle more than we need it keeps us from having to do multipleallocations while appending.benchmark old nsop new nsop deltaBenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .benchmark old allocs new allocs deltaBenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .benchmark old bytes new bytes deltaBenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .BenchmarkReplaceOrAppendEnvValues .Found that this function can often be a big allocator in actually the top allocator.Ideally we wouldn't have to process these every time we start a container or exec but changing this may require changing behaviors and needs a discussion and some deeper changes.

On startup actually shutdown the container.;When a container is left running after the daemon exits e.g. the daemonis SIGKILL'd or crashes it should stop any running containers when thedaemon starts back up.What actually happens is the daemon only sends the container'sconfigured stop signal and does not check if it has exited.If the container does not actually exit then it is left running.This fixes this unexpected behavior by calling the same function to shutdown the container that the daemon shutdown process does.Fixes        The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered

Use condition variable to wake stats collector.;Before the collection goroutine wakes up every second as configured.This sleep interval is in case there are no stats to collect we don'tend up in a tight loop.Instead use a condition variable to signal that a collection is needed.This prevents us from waking the goroutine needlessly when there is noone looking for stats.For now I've kept the sleep just moved it to the end of the loop whichgives some space between collections.This significantly speeds up the first stat collection.Example docker stats nostream goes from about .s to .s       The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered
Add stats options to not prime the stats;Metrics collectors generally don't need the daemon to prime the statswith something to compare since they already have something to comparewith.Before this change the API does collection cycles which takesroughly s in order to provide comparison for CPU usage over s. Thiswas primarily added so that docker stats nostream had something tocompare against.Really the CLI should have just made a nd call and done the comparisonitself rather than forcing it on all API consumers.That ship has long sailed though.With this change clients can set an option to just pull a single statwhich is at least a full second fasterOldtime curl unixsocketgosrcgithub.comdockerdockerbundlestestintegrationshelldocker.sockhttp.containersteststatsstreamfalse\oneshotfalse devnullrealm.suserm.ssysm.stime curl unixsocketgosrcgithub.comdockerdockerbundlestestintegrationshelldocker.sockhttp.containersteststatsstreamfalse\oneshotfalse devnullrealm.suserm.ssysm.sNewtime curl unixsocketgosrcgithub.comdockerdockerbundlestestintegrationshelldocker.sockhttp.containersteststatsstreamfalse\oneshottrue devnullrealm.suserm.ssysm.stime curl unixsocketgosrcgithub.comdockerdockerbundlestestintegrationshelldocker.sockhttp.containersteststatsstreamfalse\oneshottrue devnullrealm.suserm.ssysm.sThis fixes issues with downstream's ability to use the stats API tocollect metrics.Fixes        The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered

Check tmpfs mounts before create anon volume;This makes sure that things like tmpfs mounts over an anonymousvolume don't create volumes uneccessarily.One method only checks mountpoints the other checks both mountpointsand tmpfs... the usage of these should likely be consolidated.Ideally processing for tmpfs mounts would get merged in with therest of the mount parsing.

I opted not to do that for this change so thefix is minimal and can potentially be backported with fewer changes ofbreaking things.Merging the mount processing for tmpfs can be handled in a followup.Fixes        The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered

Fixing ?Çÿdocker cp?ÇÖ to allow new target file name in a host symlinked directory;?Çÿdocker cp?ÇÖ fails with error ?Çÿnot a directory?ÇÖ if a file is copied from a container to a host symlinked directory with a new target filename.The fix is to use os.Stat instead of os.Lstat since os.Stat follows the linked path.Fixes Issue Signedoffby Douglas Curtis dougcurtisgmail.com What I didpkgarchivecopy.go CopyInfoDestinationPath was using os.Lstat to determine whether or not the destination parent folder is a directory or not. After some experimentation with the ?Çÿos?ÇÖ package I found that FileInfo.IsDir returns false for a symlinked directory.I changed os.Lstat to os.Stat in CopyInfoDestinationPath. How I did itCode inspection led me to the CopyInfoDestinationPath. Once I noticed that os.Lstat was being used to determine directory status I performed some local experiments and found that IsDir does not report symlinked directories as true. How to verify itAfter manually reproducing the steps provided I found a test gap in TestCpFromSymlinkDestination that missed the case of a new target file name to a symlinked directory. Adding the test case reproduced the failure in the automated testing environment.After fixing the issue the test case passed as expected.Manual functional testAdd a test file to a containerUse ?Çÿdocker cp?ÇÖ to copy the file to a symlink directory as a file nameVerify that the contents of ?Çÿtestfile?ÇÖ match ?Çÿnewfilename?ÇÖResults issueut.txt Description for the changelogAdded isDirectory method to detect symlink directories in CopyInfoDestinationPath to enable copying to a new target file name located in a symlinked host directory.

Windows Don't close client stdin handle to avoid hang;Signedoffby John Howard VM jhowardmicrosoft.comFixes darrenstahlmsft johnstep PTAL.TLDR Doing the same fix on Windows as the hack on Darwin in the client hijack. It's a different underlying cause looks like a platform bug on Windows but as the process is exiting anyway there's no need to explicitly close the handle. This avoids the client hanging under certain circumstances at the point it would be exiting.Longer versionDuplicating the big comment from commentGot this down to restoreTerminal not returning in win trying to close the processes stdin handle. There's an interesting comment in the code cli\command\container\hijack.go restoreTerminal WARNING DO NOT REMOVE THE OS CHECK  For some reason this Close call blocks on darwin.. As the client exists right after simply discard the close until we find a better solution.I'm going to extend the check to exclude Windows as that does fix it. It's almost certainly a different underlying cause to Darwin but just interesting nonetheless.Some notes you only hit this ifa Using the native console not the vlegacy consoleb You start the process in a new window. ie start docker run rm it microsoftnanoserver cmd s c echo foobar will hang docker run rm it microsoftnanoserver cmd s c echo foobar will be fine.docker.exe is stuck in a CloseHandle ntdllZwClose in the following stack trace thread by the look of it.

builder Refactor remote context;depends on only new commit tonistiigidockernestedbuild...remotecontextThe builder currently seems to depend on Context interface that could be reimplemented to provide different types of sources. In reality there is only one context tarsum. That is because the real functionality for context is finding hashes for paths for cache and tarsum is the only context that can do that. Others are just helpers for making tarsum context from other inputs.Context interface hides direct access to the paths with .Path method in builder.FileInfo. Actual copy only happens through real paths and doesn't have anything to do with context methods.File hash capability is the main reason Context exists but that capability is completely missing from the interface. The implementation just recasts builder.FileInfo to builder.Hashed and would panic if they don't match.Context and Dockerfile are mixed together and builder tries to separate them while it is running. That means recasts to ModifiableContext and DockerIgnorContext. Every context passed to builder is always DockerIgnoreContext but there is nothing predicting that from the function's signature. This has a TODO but there is no way to fix that without separating these concerns.There are also actual bugs that can't be fixed like hardlink handling because the implementation is fixed to Tarsum.This PR changes the dependent interface to something that better matches the reality. Source is a path from a host and a capability to calculate hashes for paths.It also renames Context to Source so that it doesn't collide with context.Context.This enables following featuresCache hashing can be separated from the tarsum package. Raw tar headers are not the correct way calculate file hashes. For example hardlinks are completely broken because of that httpsgist.github.comtonistiigicbdbddf . This does not mean breaking the compatibility in noncritical places yet as we don't want to invalidate people's cache.Alternative implementations can be used for defining the remotes. Previous implememtation was centric to specific tar behavior.No .dockerignore magic needs to be implemented for the other implementations. For example does not need to worry about this at all.Follow upHashes for directories shouldn't be calculated by the builder. They should be provided same way as they are for the files.Move all Remote implementations and detection into a separate package. DoneRemove ModifiableContext. This is now only needed on source detection phase and Remove function can be directly called on the remote's implementation.

Add mount point to cgroup root when initializing cgroup paths for cpu.rtruntime;PR introduced a couple moreflags including cpurtruntime to the docker daemon. It appearsrecent changes or merge issues may have broken this. It currently doesnot take the cgroup mount point into account when determining the cgroupfiles to write values to. This breaks docker setting its owncpu.rtruntime for the daemon. This also means containers aren't ableto set theirs.Also the cgroups.FindCgroupMountpointAndRoot returns back a mount pointthat includes the cgroup of the currently running container when dockeris run inside a docker container. this breaks the cpurtruntimeflag when running docker in docker.

I still don't fully understand the underlying cause but is as much for correctness as anything else. During cleanup with this PR we only unpause containers if the platform supports it.

Add verbose flag to network inspect to show all services tasks in swarm mode;For swarm mode networks currently network inspect only shows endpoints local to that host. Service Discovery and overlay network reachability information gets exchanged through the gossip channel between the nodes. There have been issues where failures in the gossip channel can lead to inconsistent state across clusters. But there was no easy way to identify it.This change adds a verbose flag to the network inspect output to display all services on that network with all the task IPs and host IP where the container is running. This will be very useful to quickly identify any inconsistent state across hosts this can show up stale or incorrect IPs in DNS queries.Edit libnetwork PR has been merged.

cluster Proceed with startup if cluster component can't be created;The current behavior is for dockerd to fail to start if the swarm component can't be started for some reason. This can be difficult to debug remotely because the daemon won't be running at all so it's not possible to hit endpoints like info to see what's going on. It's also very difficult to recover from the situation since commands like docker swarm leave are unavailable.Change the behavior to allow startup to proceed.Note this is a change we'll have to communicate well. People may expect they can rely on successful daemon startup as an indicator that swarm mode is functioning though frankly I expect that in most cases people are surprised when dockerd suddenly fails to start.

An old client talking to anew daemon will ignore the new field and behave as before.Fixes .Signedoffby Ian Campbell ian.campbelldocker.com What I didCorrected docker stats output for age CPU used in the presence of offline CPUs. How I did itUpdated the types.CPUStats struct to include number of currently online CPUs from sysconfSCNPROCESSORSONLN and used that in the stats code to correctly calculate percentage CPU usage. How to verify itInstall a system with more possible CPUs than online CPUs e.g. in a VM with max vcpus set to but actual set to .This command should show CPU usagedocker run d rm name spin debianlatest timeout s bash c 'while do done' docker statsThis one should show CPU usagedocker run d rm name spin debianlatest timeout s bash c 'while do done while do done' docker statsPrevious in the CPUs present scenario they would incorrectly report and respectively.

Synchronize the cursor returned by followJournal;Make sure that the cursor value returned by followJournal is the last of the values returned by its goroutine's calls to drainJournal by waiting for the goroutine to explicitly send the intended value back to its caller. Previously if followJournal signalled the goroutine that its work was done by closing a pipe depending on scheduling it was possible for followJournal to return a value which the goroutine would also pass to drainJournal which would free the value and allocate another one.Along with this may be part of the cause for .

Hide aliases in bash completion of docker node|service;Background Docker CLI hides aliases of subcommands in its help output. The aliases only appear in the help message of such subcommands. Example docker volume list docker volume help...Commands create Create a volume inspect Display detailed information on one or more volumes ls List volumes prune Remove all unused volumes rm Remove one or more volumes... docker volume ls help...Aliases ls list...To be consistent with the CLI bash completion of such commands does not offer subcommand aliases. This means that docker volume ltab directly expands to docker volume ls without the potential match list interfering same for rm and remove.Note that the aliases are still honored once you manually typed them docker volume list tab will complete the available options.There are some historical deviations from this rule that this PR starts to resolve.

Synchronous service create and service update;Change service create and service update to wait until the creation or update finishes when detachfalse is specified. Show progress bars for the overall operation and for each individual task when there are a small enough number of tasks unless q quiet is specified.Internals The current implementation is polling. It would be much better to use the Swarm events API once it's ready dongluochen. The task endpoint spec is not included when evaluating if a task is up to date. This structure isn't exposed through the REST API so it would need to be added or we need to come up with a better way of checking if a task is up to date. The method of checking for global service convergence is a terrible hack. The constraint evaluator was ported to the client so it can tell which nodes match the constraints. This needs to be redone in a better way. Handle rollback update states once is mergedCosmeticUX The progress bars show numbers like BB assuming the units are bytes. This should be changed to drop the B suffix. Upon C the command should print a notice that the creation or update is still continuing in the background.

Automatic service rollback on failure;This PR adds support for a rollback failure action. When this is selected the orchestrator will automatically roll back to the previous version of a service if an update hits the failure threshold.It adds the following options to control the behavior of rollbacks. They are kept separate from the existing update options since there are situations where the behavior should be different for rollbacks. For example an administrator may wish to roll out a new version of a service very slowly but if failure thresholds are exceeded switch back to the old version quickly. Arguably we may be able to live with hardcoded defaults for some of these options but it seemed better to stay consistent with the update options than to introduce arbitrary differences.rollbackdelayrollbackfailureactionrollbackmaxfailureratiorollbackmonitorrollbackparallelismI'm open to reducing the set of options if desired but at a minimum we should keep rollbackdelay and rollbackparallelism.This PR also switches the manually invoked service update rollback to work on the server side instead of being a purely client side operation. This allows manuallyinitiated rollbacks to respect the new rollback parameters and it also has the benefits of avoiding some nasty hacks we previously used. The client is versionaware so it will still use the old method against an older daemon.Note that rollback has been changed so that it can't be used in combination with other service update flags. This is a compromise to avoid adding further hacks. While it's unfortunate to be restricting this functionality it does make the implementation much cleaner.cc aluzzardi dongluochen       The text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered
